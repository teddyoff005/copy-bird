# Game Improvement Suggestions

## Gameplay

*   **Power-ups:** Add power-ups that appear randomly, such as a shield that protects the bird from one hit, or a coin that doubles the score for a short period.
*   **Increasing Difficulty:** The game's difficulty could increase over time. For example, the pipes could start moving faster, or the gap between them could become smaller as the score increases.
*   **Different Bird Abilities:** Introduce different birds with unique abilities. For example, a smaller bird that can fit through tighter gaps, or a bird that can flap its wings faster.

## Visuals

*   **Parallax Scrolling:** Add a parallax scrolling effect to the background to create a better sense of depth and immersion. This would involve having multiple background layers moving at different speeds.
*   **More Scenery:** Add more scenery elements to the game, such as trees, mountains, or buildings in the background.
*   **Weather Effects:** Add weather effects, such as rain or snow, to make the game more visually interesting.

## Audio

*   **Sound Effects:** Add sound effects for flapping, scoring, and crashing to make the game more engaging.
*   **Background Music:** Add some background music to the game to set the mood.

## UI/UX

*   **Leaderboard:** Add a leaderboard to the game to allow players to compete with each other for the high score.
*   **Settings Menu:** Add a settings menu that allows players to adjust the volume of the music and sound effects.
